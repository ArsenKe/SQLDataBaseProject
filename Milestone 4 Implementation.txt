I manage to execute DDL to create tables and foreign keys.I loop through all tables and load data from csv. Databasehelper connects
database. Then, drop existing object if there are any. I create tables with foreign keys separately. Next, write load function for each table
and call them sequantily. Each function reads respective csv file into a buffer reader row by row. Each row is splitted by comma to create an array
of columns.
This columns are passed to insert function to databasehelper class. These insert functions take the column data as parameter, prepare a sql  statement 
to insert data and execute the statement with an try catch block.If there is exception we are notifed. After loading cvs files to tables the objects are released
and database connection is closed. During the execution each process displaces consol messages , providing the information about the tuples.

The php app is designed to work behind the secure login. On succesfull login there is dashboard which displays information about various entities , each entity access to listing page.
The listing page request the data using databasehelper class, and display all the tuples in tableformat. The listpage provides the functionality to search the records, add the new record,
delete an existing record and modify any displayed record. Clicking an added button opens the new form view, where user can enter or change information and save the database.
There is another parentchild view which dislays information of the tables connected by foreign key relationship.
Order detail page shows the ordering information of parent table and all child records or all item in cart table.
User can add and delete or modify items in cart for any other or modify information on same page. Visual is designed with help of bootstrap.
